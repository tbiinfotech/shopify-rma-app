# Project Brief

----

Developed a custom Shopify RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) app for one of our clients who was looking for a systematic solution for returns/exchange authorization feature for its Shopify store. He wanted us to develop an RMA portal where the customers can simply sign in to their accounts on the website, fill in a return authorization form, and be issued with a valid authorization number and the need to track things manually gets eliminated.
